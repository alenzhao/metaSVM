\usage{iSVM(sm, is.constant=TRUE)}
\arguments{
   \item{sm}{A list generated from \code{SETUP}}
   \item{is.constant}{if TRUE, an intercept is included in the model; default is TRUE.}
}
\value{A list contains information on the final model}
\description{
This function develops an estiamation and variable selection algorithm for
meta-analytic framework based on the support vector machine (Meta-SVM).
}
\details{
The proposed Meta-SVM is motivated by the recent meta-analytic method exploiting the logistic regression.
We develop a novel implementation strategy in spirit of Newtonâ€™s method in the Meta-SVM. For the most part, the objective function of SVM is formed with the hinge loss and a range of penalty terms (e.g., L1-lasso, group lasso and etcs).
We particularly adopts the sparse group lasso enabling to capture both common and study specific genetic signals among all studies.
